We dont use only 10% of our brain. Imaging brains with functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) at rest shows that &gt;10% of the brain (&gt;10%) is active. Injuries to the brain would most likely lead to some form of impairment: Many neuropsychological studies show that patients with brain damage are impaired in aspects like decision-making, facial recognition, language processing etc.. (entirely depends on where in the brain is damaged) Conclusion: The claim that we only use 10% of our brain is not supported by evidence . It is important that we dont whole-heartedly accept a claim until we evaluate them logically.
